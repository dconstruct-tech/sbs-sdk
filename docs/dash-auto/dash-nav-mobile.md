![Optional Panels](img/dash-nav-mobile/option-panels.png){style="width: 300px;"} 

---

### 4. View Tab
The view tab contains options for changing the view and configuring the map that was loaded into the application.

#### 4.1 Adjusting your view of the map
![Functionality Icon](img/dash-nav-mobile/pointer.png){style="height:20px;"} Pinch to zoom in or zoom out

![Functionality Icon](img/dash-nav-mobile/pointer.png){style="height:20px;"} Swipe with one finger to adjust view angle

![Functionality Icon](img/dash-nav-mobile/pointer.png){style="height:20px;"} Swipe with two fingers to move around the map

![Adjust View GIF](img/dash-nav-mobile/adjust-view.gif)

Select this button on the top left corner to reset view to default.

![Reset View Button](img/dash-nav-mobile/reset-view.png)

#### 4.2 Map View Configurations
##### Clipping 
Move the points on the range slider to adjust how much floor/ceiling is shown on the map of your application.

![Clipping Visualisations](img/dash-nav-mobile/clipping.png){style="width: 600px;"}

##### Contours
Toggle on and off or adjust the contour level to adjust contour sensitivity. 

![Contour Visualisations](img/dash-nav-mobile/contour.png){style="width: 600px;"}

#### 4.3 Example of a bad map visualization
The View Tab allows you to customise your map-viewing experience within the application. It provides you with the flexibility to configure the settings according to your preferences. While keeping the default settings is perfectly acceptable, it's recommended to adjust the thumbs in a way that ensures the floor of the map is visible, the ceiling is hidden, and artefacts remain visible for optimal viewing.

![Bad Visualisations Example](img/dash-nav-mobile/bad-visualization.jpg){style="width: 600px;"}

The ceiling covers the entire map and you are unable to see the artifacts below, hence this is a bad map visualization. To make this visualization better and clearer, let's adjust the ceiling knob lower until the ceiling is hidden.

![Adjust Ceiling GIF](img/dash-nav-mobile/adjust-ceiling.gif){style="width: 600px;"}

This way, we can better see where our robot is located on the map when we run a route or control the robot.

---

### 5. Plan Tab
The plan tab is used for preparing routes for your robots to follow and perform BLK scans.

![Plan Tab View](img/dash-nav-mobile/plan-tab.png){style="margin-top: 10px; width: 1000px;"}

#### 5.1 Creating your route

#### 5.1.3.1 BLK Configurations
##### LiDAR Scan Quality

LiDAR Scan Quality affects the density of the data points generated in your point cloud map. 

![LiDAR Scan Quality Options](img/dash-nav-mobile/lidar-scan-quality-options.jpg){style="width: 200px;"}

![Functionality Icon](img/dash-nav-mobile/pointer.png){style="height:20px;"} Low: This option would produce a sparse point cloud map, but it does so at a much quicker rate.

![Functionality Icon](img/dash-nav-mobile/pointer.png){style="height:20px;"} Medium: This option strikes a balance between point cloud density and scanning efficiency.

![Functionality Icon](img/dash-nav-mobile/pointer.png){style="height:20px;"} High: This option will generate a dense point cloud map, but it takes considerably more time to do so.

##### Image Capture Mode

![Image Capture Mode Options](img/dash-nav-mobile/image-capture-mode-options.jpg){style="width: 200px;"}

![Functionality Icon](img/dash-nav-mobile/pointer.png){style="height:20px;"} None: Does not utilize the camera for capturing images.

![Functionality Icon](img/dash-nav-mobile/pointer.png){style="height:20px;"} LDR (Low Dynamic Range): Details in shadows may be lost or details in highlights may be blown out.

![Functionality Icon](img/dash-nav-mobile/pointer.png){style="height:20px;"} HDR (High Dynamic Range): More detail in both highlights and shadows can be captured. 

#### 5.1.3.2 Auto generation of scan points
In this section, you can automatically generate BLK scanning points in your route based on the distance travelled by the robot.
To use this, you must already have a route with waypoints. If you do not have one, refer to [Section 6.1.1](#section6_1_1) for a guide on recording your waypoints by manually controlling your robot or refer to [Section 6.1.2](#section6_1_2) for a guide on creating your route by manually plotting waypoints.

To enable this feature, turn this option on and set a distance interval. If your set distance interval is two metres, the robot will run a BLK scan roughly every two metres travelled along your route.
![Auto Generate Scan Points GIF](img/dash-nav-mobile/auto-generate-scan-points.gif){style="margin-top: 10px;"style="margin-top: 10px;"}
The generated blinking points on the map is where your robot will apply a BLK scan.

To clear all BLK scanning points, select 'Clear all Scan Points' in the options menu. 

#### 5.1.3.3 Manually setting scan points
To use this, you must already have a route with waypoints. If you do not have one, refer to [Section 6.1.1](#section6_1_1) for a guide on recording your waypoints by manually controlling your robot or refer to [Section 6.1.2](#section6_1_2) for a guide on creating your route by manually plotting waypoints.
Select the Scan Mode button at the bottom of the screen, and press the waypoints where you want your robot to perform a BLK scan.

Upon submitting the initial pose estimate, the robot will attempt to determine its current position on the map. During this process, there may be a momentary "jump" in the robot's position. You are advised to manually move the robot around using the robot's controller to ensure that the LiDAR point cloud is still aligned with the map.

#### 7. Offline Mode
If your scanning location does not have internet access, you can connect to your robot's hotspot through your device's Wi-Fi settings and use offline mode to login to your robot to carry out the same tasks as you would in online mode. To use this, you may follow the instructions below. 

Before using offline mode, ensure that your map has already been downloaded in online mode. This is because there is no internet connection and the app is unable to fetch the maps from your cloud. Refer to [Section 3.2](#section3_2) for a guide on loading your map into the application.
